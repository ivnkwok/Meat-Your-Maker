### Meat Your Maker
A game where you feed meat to an insatiable meat god to stave off its wrath and prevent disaster. The more you feed, the more it demands. It additionally has 2FA with an email login and phone verification.

This game was created for the [Fall 2024 Crimson Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/crimson-game-jam-fall-2024), and the theme was "meet your maker".

Controls: WASD to move, mouse to aim 

When you enter the meat god's cave at the center of the map you can sacrifice or sell your meat. If you don't sacrifice enough meat, the meat god summons a flood. When you sell your meat, you earn coins which can be used to buy upgrades for collecting more meat.
